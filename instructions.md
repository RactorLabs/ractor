# Sandbox Startup Instructions

<!--
  Replace this content with Markdown guidance that the sandbox should see in
  /sandbox/instructions.md. Keep it concise—short bullet points or numbered
  steps—so operators immediately understand the sandbox mission.
-->

- Document the sandbox goal or any temporary procedures here.
- Include credentials or API keys only via environment variables, never in this file.
- Update or clear this file before starting a new sandbox if the guidance no longer applies.
