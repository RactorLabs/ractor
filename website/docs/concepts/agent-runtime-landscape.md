- Need session persistence and advanced state management
- Building agent-first applications with computer-use capabilities
- **Value "deploy and go" simplicity** over complex enterprise features

## Market Evolution

The universal AI agent runtime market is rapidly evolving with clear trends:

**Enterprise Consolidation**: Major cloud providers integrating agent runtimes into existing platforms
**Framework Standardization**: Push toward platform-specific frameworks and tools
**Vendor Lock-in**: Increasing dependency on proprietary ecosystems and APIs

**Raworc's Counter-Trend**: True universality, framework flexibility, and deployment freedom - positioning as the "Universal Agent Runtime" that works with any framework, deploys anywhere, and avoids vendor lock-in. **Most importantly: the simplest developer experience in the industry** - deploy agents like serverless functions without infrastructure complexity.

### **Market Statistics (2025)**

Based on recent industry research:
- **51% of teams** already run agents in production
- **78% plan to deploy** within 12 months  
- **Mid-sized companies** (100-2000 employees) most aggressive at 63%
- **LangChain adoption**: 220% GitHub star growth, 300% download increase

## The Bottom Line

**Agent runtimes solve the "deployment gap"** between AI framework capabilities and production requirements. Just as web frameworks need application servers, and mobile apps need operating systems, **AI agents need runtimes**.

The choice is:
- **Build infrastructure yourself**: Months of DevOps work, security risks, ongoing maintenance
- **Use enterprise platforms**: Complex setup, vendor lock-in, steep learning curves
- **Use Raworc**: **Deploy like serverless functions** - simple, fast, framework-agnostic

For serious agent builders who value developer experience, **Raworc offers the simplest path from idea to production** while maintaining complete framework freedom and avoiding vendor lock-in.
