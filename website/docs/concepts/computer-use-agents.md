# Computer Use Agents

Raworc provides Computer Use Agents through the agent runtime that uses computers like humans do to automate manual work. Each agent comes with a dedicated computer and can perform any task that a human worker can do through natural language instructions.

## What are Computer Use Agents?

The agent runtime interacts with computers using the same interfaces humans use:

- **Visual interfaces** - Click buttons, fill forms, navigate websites
- **Command line tools** - Execute terminal commands, run scripts, manage files  
- **Desktop applications** - Use any software installed on the computer
- **File operations** - Create, edit, move, and organize files and folders
- **Web browsing** - Navigate websites, extract data, interact with web applications
