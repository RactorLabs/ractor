# Agent Runtime

## What is an Agent Runtime?

A **Universal AI Agent Runtime** is a platform designed to manage the entire lifecycle of AI agents, providing a standardized environment for deployment, scaling, and operation. These runtimes handle core functions such as orchestrating tool calls, managing agent state, ensuring security through isolation, and offering observability for debugging and performance monitoring.

Agent runtimes support dynamic scaling to adapt to workload demands, optimize resource allocation, and automatically clean up unused resources to improve cost-efficiency. Unlike traditional platforms that focus on model inference, agent runtimes provide containerized sessions, computer-use capabilities, and enterprise operations specifically designed for AI agent workloads.

### Key Features of Modern Agent Runtimes

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: Robust support for enabling agents to communicate and collaborate on complex tasks with intelligent delegation and shared workspace management.

**Secure Isolation**: Sandboxed environments to prevent cross-interference and maintain data integrity through container isolation and resource controls.

**LLM Integration**: Support for various large language models (LLMs), allowing developers to choose the most suitable model for their agent's specific role and requirements.

**Tool Integration**: Extensive connectivity enabling agents to access external data sources like databases, APIs, and enterprise systems, as well as perform actions such as file operations and web browsing.

**Session Management**: Persistent state management with pause/resume capabilities for long-running workflows and complex multi-step operations.

**Enterprise Operations**: Production-ready features including RBAC, audit trails, secrets management, and compliance capabilities.

## Runtime vs. Framework: The Missing Layer

### The Development Stack Gap

**AI Frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen):
- Provide development libraries and abstractions
- Handle agent logic, workflows, and chains  
- Focus on the **building** experience
- Don't solve deployment, scaling, or operational concerns

**Agent Runtime** (Raworc):
- Provides the **execution environment** for any agent
- Handles infrastructure concerns (containers, networking, persistence)
- Manages agent **lifecycle** and **operations**
- Enables **multi-tenancy** and **enterprise security**

### Framework-Agnostic Architecture

```
Runtime Layer:    [Universal Agent Runtime]
Framework Layer:  [LangChain] [CrewAI] [AutoGen] [Custom]
Application:      [Your AI Agents]
```

This separation enables:
- **Framework Democracy**: Use any AI framework without vendor lock-in
- **BYOA (Bring Your Own Agents)**: Deploy agents from any GitHub repository
- **Zero Dependencies**: Agents require no runtime-specific SDKs
- **Mixed Deployments**: Different frameworks can coexist in same environment

## Core Runtime Responsibilities

### 1. Execution Environment Management
- **Isolated Containers**: Secure execution boundaries per session
- **Pre-built Images**: Zero-cold-start with `raworc_space_{name}:{build-id}` images
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python (venv), Node.js (npm), Rust (cargo)
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic build-time compilation and caching

### 2. Session Lifecycle Orchestration
- **State Machine**: `init → idle → busy → paused → suspended → error`
- **Persistence**: Data survives container pause/resume cycles
- **Session Forking**: Create child sessions from parent sessions
- **Data Lineage**: Complete workflow history and relationships

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Intelligent Delegation**: LLM-powered agent selection
- **Shared Workspaces**: Agents collaborate within unified environments
- **Context Passing**: Structured conversation history between agents
- **Framework Mixing**: Different agent types in same session

### 4. Enterprise Operations
- **RBAC System**: Space-scoped permissions and role-based access
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage controls
- **Audit Trails**: Complete operation tracking and attribution
- **Secret Management**: Encrypted credential storage per space

### 5. Production Infrastructure
- **CLI-First Design**: Comprehensive CLI and REST API for programmatic management
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections and caching
- **Task Queues**: Async processing with MySQL backend
- **Monitoring**: Resource usage and performance tracking

## Runtime Architecture Benefits

### Operational Advantages
- **Session Persistence**: Pause complex workflows, resume later
- **Resource Efficiency**: Containers only consume resources when active
- **Fault Tolerance**: Agents survive infrastructure changes
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent agent sessions

### Developer Experience
- **Universal Interface**: Single `raworc.json` manifest for any agent
- **No Lock-in**: Switch frameworks without infrastructure changes  
- **Instant Deployment**: Pre-compiled dependencies enable immediate startup
- **REST API**: Complete HTTP API for all operations

### Security & Compliance
- **Container Isolation**: Agents cannot access host system directly
- **Encrypted Secrets**: AES encryption for API keys and credentials
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions per space and user
- **Process Sandboxing**: Resource limits and security constraints

## Infrastructure-as-a-Service for AI Agents

The agent runtime abstracts away operational complexity, allowing developers to focus on agent logic rather than deployment concerns. It provides:

- **Compute**: Isolated execution environments with resource controls
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes and session data management  
- **Networking**: Secure container networking and external access
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Monitoring**: Observability and audit capabilities

This positions the agent runtime as the **missing infrastructure layer** between AI frameworks and production deployment, enabling enterprises to run AI agents at scale with the same operational rigor as traditional applications.

## The Production Deployment Problem

Most AI agent builders face the same progression:

1. **Prototype Success**: Build amazing agents locally with LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen
2. **Production Reality**: Struggle to deploy, scale, and maintain agents reliably
3. **Infrastructure Burden**: Spend more time on DevOps than agent logic
4. **Security Concerns**: Worry about agents accessing production systems directly
5. **Operational Overhead**: Manual session management and resource monitoring

**The core issue**: AI frameworks solve development, but ignore deployment and operations.

## Why Use Agent Runtime?

### The Current Agent Development Problem

Most AI agent builders face the same progression:

1. **Prototype Success**: Build amazing agents locally with LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen
2. **Production Reality**: Struggle to deploy, scale, and maintain agents reliably
3. **Infrastructure Burden**: Spend more time on DevOps than agent logic
4. **Security Concerns**: Worry about agents accessing production systems directly
5. **Operational Overhead**: Manual session management and resource monitoring

### Why Agent Builders Need Runtimes

#### 1. Production Deployment Challenges

**Without Runtime:**
```bash
# Manual deployment nightmare
git clone agent-repo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python main.py &  # Hope it doesn't crash
```

**With Agent Runtime:**
```bash
# Professional deployment
raworc api spaces -m post -b '{"name":"my-team"}'
raworc api spaces/my-team/agents -m post -b '{
  "name": "sales-agent",
  "source_repo": "github.com/company/sales-agent"
}'
raworc api sessions -m post -b '{"space":"my-team"}'
# Agent runs with monitoring, logging, RBAC
```

#### 2. Security & Isolation

**The Problem:**
- Agents running on your laptop/server have full system access
- API keys scattered across environment variables
- No boundaries between different agent projects
- Production systems at risk from agent errors

**Runtime Solution:**
- **Container Isolation**: Each agent session runs in secure boundaries
- **Encrypted Secrets**: Centralized, encrypted credential management
- **Space Separation**: Multi-tenant isolation between projects/teams
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent runaway agents from consuming all resources

#### 3. Session Management & Persistence

**Current Pain Points:**
- Agents lose context when processes restart
- No way to pause long-running workflows
- Manual tracking of multi-step operations
- Lost work when systems crash

**Runtime Benefits:**
- **Pause/Resume**: Stop agents mid-workflow, resume exactly where left off
- **Session Forking**: Create experimental branches from existing sessions
- **Data Lineage**: Track parent-child session relationships
- **Persistent Storage**: Work survives container restarts

#### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
# Fragile multi-agent coordination
researcher = Agent(role="researcher")
writer = Agent(role="writer") 
# How do they share context? Files? Database?
# What if one crashes? How to restart just that agent?
```

**Runtime Approach:**
```python
# Intelligent agent delegation
# Runtime automatically routes tasks to appropriate agents
# Shared workspace and context handling built-in
# Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
```

#### 5. Framework Lock-in Avoidance

**The Risk:**
- Build everything in LangChain, then need CrewAI features
- Framework changes breaking production agents
- Vendor dependencies limiting architectural choices

**Runtime Freedom:**
- **BYOA**: Use any framework or mix multiple frameworks
- **Migration Path**: Gradually move agents between frameworks
- **Best-of-Breed**: Choose optimal framework per use case
- **Future-Proof**: Runtime evolves independently of frameworks

### When You Need an Agent Runtime
