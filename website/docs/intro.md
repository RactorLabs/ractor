## What is Raworc?

Raworc is the **Universal AI Agent Runtime** that solves the deployment gap between AI framework capabilities and production requirements. Instead of spending time fighting infrastructure, developers can focus on building agents while Raworc handles containerized execution, session management, and enterprise operations.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **BYOA (Bring Your Own Agents)** - Framework-agnostic runtime supporting any agent from any GitHub repository
- 📦 **Containerized Sessions** - Each session runs in its own dedicated container environment with complete isolation
- 🖥️ **Computer-use Capabilities** - Agents have full access to filesystem operations, web browsers, and system-level tools
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - LLM-powered delegation with intelligent routing and context passing
- 🔐 **Enterprise-Grade Security** - JWT + RBAC with space-scoped permissions and encrypted secrets
- 🏗️ **Universal Agent Runtime** - Infrastructure-as-a-Service for AI agents with professional deployment and monitoring

## How Raworc Works

Raworc provides the missing infrastructure layer between AI frameworks and production deployment:

1. **Deploy Any Agent** - BYOA support for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom implementations
2. **Containerized Sessions** - Each agent runs in isolated containers with persistent state
3. **Enterprise Operations** - Built-in RBAC, secrets management, and monitoring
4. **Production Ready** - REST API and enterprise-grade security
